                            the server is English Only.
                            You must communicate in English at all times in the server. Including voice chats. Zalgo

                            Discord's ToS that's why we
                            have to ban everyone under the age of 13 or age limit of Discord in your country.</p>

                    <div class="chatrulesc">
                        <span class="high">1: Be respectful; keep negativity to a minimum</span>
                        <p>Treat everyone how you would like to be treated. Do not directly swear or make rude comments
                            to other users, starting unnecessary fights and drama will not be tolerated here. Civil
                            debates are allowed to an extent however creating fights that will lead to nowhere will
                            result in a punishment.</p>
                        <br>
                        <span class="high">RULE 2: No Inappropriate/NSFW content</span><br>
                        <p>Keep things appropriate for everyone. Sending NSFW content, such as messages, media or
                            overall sexual behavior will result in serious consequences. Having inappropriate remarks in
                            your public profile will also result in a ban.</p>
                        <br>
                        <span class="high">RULE 3: No Profane Language</span>
                        <p>Simple swearing (e.g. f*ck and sh*t) is allowed to a certain extent (refer to rule 1) but
                            using extreme slurs that are racist, homophobic, transphobic or discrimination at all will
                            result in a permanent ban.</p>
                        <br>
                        <span class="high">RULE 4: No Spamming</span>
                        <p>Spamming can mean many things, examples are sending many messages within a short period of
                            time, sending text walls (messages that take space on a lot of the screen), chaining lyrics,
                            sending attachments repetitively etc. Making the overall experience in the chat bad can also
                            be considered spam.</p>
                        <br>
                        <span class="high"> 5: No Mini-modding</span>
                        <p>If something needs to be moderated, leave it to the staff. Don't moderate the server or give
                            out false information to users. If you think something needs to be taken care of, ping an
                            active staff member or report the issue in #support-tickets.</p>
                        <br>
                        <span class="high">RULE 6: No Begging</span>
                        <p>Do not ask for free Nitro, Roles, Bot currency or anything else. We don't randomly hand out
                            things for free excluding giveaways. Do not ask for free stuff, continuing will result in a
                            punishment.</p>
                        <br>
                        <span class="high">RULE 7: Terms of Service</span>
                        <p>Abide by the Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. Not following to do so may
                            result in a ban from the server.</p>
                        <br>
                        <span class="high">RULE 8: Wasting Staff's Time</span>
                        <p>Do not waste staff's time, this can include direct messaging staff to appeal your punishment,
                            opening tickets for no reason, or annoying them in general. If you have a complaint against
                            a higher staff member, contact a higher position staff.</p>
                        <br>

                        <span class="high">RULE 9: Advertisement</span>
                        <p>Promoting your socials, servers or creations outside of advertising channels is strictly
                            prohibited. DM Advertising will result in an instant ban.</p>
                        <br>

                        <span class="high">RULE 10: Use Common Sense</span>
                        <p>You may be warned for certain rules that are not listed here. We can't list everything but be
                            a decent human being and don't be stupid and you'll stay. Loopholing these rules can result
                            in severe punishment.</p>
